The total size of the data cannot be greater than 6KB. For calculation purposes, this includes keys and values, the quotes that surround them, the \&quot;:\&quot; character that separates them, the commas that separate the pairs, and the opening and closing braces around the field. However, any whitespace between key/value pairs is not included in the calculation of the payload size.

    :param expires_after_seconds: The number of seconds that the message will be retained to retry if message delivery is not successful. Allowed values are from 60 (1 minute) to 86400 (1 day), inclusive. The default is 3600 (1 hour). Multiple retries may occur during this interval. The retry logic is exponential. The first retry executes after 30 seconds, and this time period doubles on every retry. The retries will end when the total time elapsed since the message was first sent has exceeded the value you provided for expiresAfterSeconds. Message expiry is rarely a problem if the message handler has been set up correctly. With a correct setup, you will receive the message once promptly. This mechanism for retries is provided as a safeguard in case your skill goes down during a message delivery.
