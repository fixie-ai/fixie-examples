  The `movieposters` agent will generate posters for movies. 

  You can ask it for a poster of an existing movie (e.g., "Tron"), or you can ask it to
  make a poster for a movie that doesn't exist and see what it comes up with (e.g., "The
  Lost Book of the Dead").

  Example queries:
    - Make me a movie poster for the movie "Tron".
    - Create a poster for "The Lost Book of the Dead".
