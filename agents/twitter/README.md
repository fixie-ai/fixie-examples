This is an example Fixie Agent that answers questions about Twitter activity.

To use it, first get a Twitter API key from: https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/essential/basic-info

Place this key in a file called `twittertoken.txt`.

You also need an OpenAI API key. Please this in a file called `openaikey.txt`.

Then, run:
```
fixie deploy
```
