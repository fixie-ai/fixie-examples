  The `stock` agent is capable of looking up stock prices for a given company.

  `stock` can determine the proper ticker symbol from the company name or you can provide one directly.

  Example queries:
    - How did Apple do today?
    - What is the current stock price for NVDA?
    - Who did better today, Apple or Google?
