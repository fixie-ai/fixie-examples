  The `stock` agent is capable of looking up stock prices for a given company.

  `stock` can determine the proper ticker symbol from the company name or you can provide one directly.

  Example queries:
    - How did Apple do today?
    - What is the current stock price for NVDA?
    - Who did better today, Apple or Google?
tests:
  - query: What is the price of Caterpillar?
    expected: The response should be similar to "The share price for Caterpillar is $229.86."
