Subject: Sales Targets Missed
Dear [Executive Name],
I regret to inform you that we have missed our sales targets for the last quarter, and our revenue is well below expectations. We need to review our sales strategies and make changes to our approach to try to turn this around.

Best,
[Sender Name]
