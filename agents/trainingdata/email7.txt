Subject: Legal Action Against the Company
Dear [Executive Name],
I wanted to alert you that we are facing legal action from a former employee who is alleging wrongful termination and discrimination. This could have significant financial and reputational implications for our company, and we need to work with our legal team to mitigate these risks.

Best regards,
