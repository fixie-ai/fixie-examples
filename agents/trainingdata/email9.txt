Subject: Supplier Payment Delays
Dear [Executive Name],
I regret to inform you that we are experiencing delays in paying our suppliers due to our cash flow situation. This could have negative consequences for our relationships with these suppliers and our ability to obtain future credit. We need to find a solution to this problem as soon as possible.

Best,
[Sender Name]
